# Credit Karma - Championing financial progress for all 

## Overview and Origin

The focus of my case study will be Credit Karma. The idea for the company was started in 2007 by Kenneth Lin and cofounders Nichole Mustard and Ryan Graciano. It was incorporated on March 8, 2007, but the initial webpage did not go public until September of that year. The idea was started by Kenneth Lin who had previously worked in the credit card industry. He believed that the average consumer has a right to know their credit score so that they may have the necessary information when making important financial decisions. Years ago Mr. Lin did an interview with a Christian blog website where he stated, "I tried a credit monitoring service and couldnâ€™t understand why it was so expensive to monitor my own score. I mean it was my score, why should I have to pay so much for it?" 

With this in mind Mr. Lin decided to start a company that would offer people the ability to check their credit scores for free. As the years went by he and his team added a number of other useful applications and services to their credit karma product, all in the name of helping the everyday man achieve financial control over his own future. Credit Karma's initial funding of $2.5 million was acquired through venture capital firms such as SV Angel and Founders Fund. The company is predicated on the idea of helping the everyday man therefore the product offered is completely free. The company makes its money through referral fees from banks and other financial institutions that benefit from their consumer base.



## Business Activities

Credit Karma's main goal when entering the credit industry was to ensure that customers were not being charged for their own credit information. People should have a right to their own information especially if said inforamtion can make a world of difference when it comes to financial decison making. The company hopes to help its users though autonomous finance i.e. making financial goals and using the technology to manage spending habits to achieve those goals. Due to this, it has become increasingly popular among Generation Z and Millenials. Currently the company has over 100 million users  in 3 countries. Generation Z and Millenials account for over more than half of the user base. 

Before Credit Karma, in 2003, the US government passed the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act which allowed people to get a free credit report once every 12 months from the 3 consumer credit reporting companies. If the consumer wanted his score checked for a second time within a given year then he would be obligated to buy the information. Credit Karma was one of the first companies to give consumers the option to check their credit scores for free. Along with having a first movers adavantage, the emerged as astrong start up force right out of the 2008 recession.  I believe this also worked in Credit Karma's favor as a number of Americans had been financially wiped out and were in need to start their process of building up once again. Credit Karma became the premier personal finance applications. 

Currently Credit Karma is making use of number of technologies in its tech stack. I have added links to groups of technologies emloyed

## Landscape

Credit Karma is considered to be a fintech company specifically in the domain of personal finance and software. After Credit Karmas emergence in 2008, we can see a number of new personal finance companies open up as well for example Nerd Wallet, Mint (now Intuit Mint), LendStreet, and Credit Sesame. Over the last 5-10 years this industry has seen an explosion in the number of users and companies in the space. Some of the common trends and or innovations have been the ability to let consumers check free credit scores, budgeting software, acting as the middleman between consumers and different creditors, utilizing AI to help consumers understand spending and improve money management habits.  

## Results

Credit Karma is the leader in the personal fianance industry. They have branched out further from just offering people free credit scores. Currently they offer help when looking for new credit cards, finding the appropriate lender for home, auto, or personal loans and have even started offering tax services through Cash App Taxes. As a company they have been doing phenomenally well. Their estimated annual revenue for 2021 was $865 million. Over the last 3 year quarters they show an upward [revenue trend](images/CK-financials.PNG). They also show to have over 100 million users out of which 37 million are the monthly active users. It is thanks to this performance that Credit Karma was bought by Intuit for $8.1 billion dollars. Credit Karma continues to be remain a distinct brand from Intuit. When compared to its competitors, Credit Karma blows them away by the sheer volume of users and revenue being generated. 


## Recommendations

I think that with the current position Credit Karma has it should look to jump into developing AI for personal finance. Along with this Credit Karma should look into applications similar to that of Mint and or Personal Capital. Personal Capital is a wealth management company that offers software that lets you link all your bank accounts, securities accounts, loans, and anything else all into one place. This allows the user to have a one stop shop to view and manage all accounts. I think something similar would be extremely beneficial for Credit Karma. It would give Credit Karmas system a broader view of a given users finances. If integrated into the system and with the help of AI, Credit Karma could become more efficient in matching prospective debtors to creditors. 

In order to build such an application I think it can be broken down into a few parts:

* Linking all accounts to one webpage. This can be achieved by using API's to get the necessary data from the respective parties for example:- Chase bank API, Tradestation API

* In regards to the AI, the company should look to develop off of python as they are already utilizing it. They would need to develop a neural network and apply said network over a large source of data.
